#  This script creates a bunch of certifictes to work with for
#  testing and/or developing (on) the 'flow' system
#
#  Usage: create-certificates-selfsigned.sh name1 name2 name3
#
#  This creates self-signed certificates for name1, name2, name3
#
#     name1.crt (as also name1.key and name1.csr) and so on
#

# DES may be nodes to generate the key unencrypted or des3 to do otherwise
